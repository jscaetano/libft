This the first project called libft for 42 School.
======

The goal is to create our own library to use during the cursus.

First, you must redo a set of functions from the libc. Your functions will have the
same prototypes and implement the same behaviors as the originals. They must comply
with the way they are defined in their man. The only difference will be their names. They
will begin with the ’ft_’ prefix.

Then, you must develop a set of functions that are either not in the libc,
or that are part of it but in a different form.

The bonus part is to create functions to manipulate lists, something that is going to prove very useful in future projects.

The library should be created using 'ar'. And a libft.a should be created in the root of the repository.

The full subject was added to the root of the repository as well.
